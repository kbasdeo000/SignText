            <p><i>Our Vision</i></p>
            <p>  SignText translates American Sign Language (ASL) into the written English alphabet, built from a machine learning model of our creation. Our goals are to give the DDH community another means of communication and to bridge the language gap between hearing and non-hearing peoples. </p>
