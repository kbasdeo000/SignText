Neural Networks: 
A set of algorithms modeled loosely after the human brain, designed to recognize patterns. Training examples are used to develop a system that can train and learn from those examples. 
Ultimately, they are making predictions
The larger the training sample â†’ the more accurate the predictions.
For example: recognizing the written numbers 1-10: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html
